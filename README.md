# Bookverse

An Android app that lets you buy and sell or auction books on your own without a third vendor. It has the ability to scan books so the user can add new books within seconds.

## Statement of Problem

It might be challenging for readers to get their hands on the books they want to read. The problem relies on their ability to get hold of the book, either because it is unavailable, expensive, or has a limited number of prints available. There are times when other people have these books, but for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that they have already finished reading or are in need of some money, these books are of no use to them. 

This Android app will be designed to solve the book-sharing problem of students or the common public in general. It provides a platform for any user, who has a book that is not needed anymore and would like to share it with another user who may need it. The user can either purchase the book they need or sell the book they don’t need anymore. It will also provide a platform for users to auction off their rare collectibles and sell them to the highest bidder. It will be a fast and easy way to connect directly with the buyers and sellers. The sellers can quickly add their books by scanning the books’ barcode, the app will automatically fill in the book’s details and the user can edit the price.
